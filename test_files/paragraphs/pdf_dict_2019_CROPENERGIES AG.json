CropEnergies took account of the difficult market situation by taking a break in production at the ethanol plant at its Wilton site in the UK from December 2018 until resumption of operations at the beginning of March 2019. Nevertheless, in the past financial year, CropEnergies was able to make good use of capacities, producing 1.0 (1.1) million m3 of ethanol.

Given global \u00adpetrol fuel consumption of around 1.5 billion m3, this is equivalent to a share of more than 7 vol.-%. Despite a slightly downward trend in 2019, the traditional market segment for beverages, cosmetics and medical or industrial applications is globally relatively stable and has been hovering for years around 18 million m3 of alcohol a year. Global production of ethanol is expected to rise further in 2019. The growth which is again attributable to the fuel segment is, however, expected to remain manageable, at 1.5% (6.9%).",

The proportion of renewable energies in the EU is now set to rise to at least 32% in all sectors by 2030. Parliament and Council were also in favour of a specific target for the transport sector, which was defined at a minimum of 14%. Renewable fuels from arable crops are to be able to contribute up to one percentage point above the level reached in 2020. The proportion of fuels from wastes and residues is to rise from 0.2% in 2022 to at least 3.5% in 2030.
