The vast majority of the interest-bearing external funds relate to borrower\u2019s note loans that were issued in February 2017 with a total nominal value of \u20ac 40.0 million and varying maturities (3, 5 and 7 years).

The investments and repayments in 2018 were financed first of all using the positive cash flow from operating activities in the amount of \u20ac 3,326 thousand and by implementing a capital increase resulting in a net cash inflow of \u20ac 16,970 thousand. Furthermore, there are financial liabilities that contribute to the financing of operating business activities in the form of trade payables and obligations to employees. They are offset by various financial assets, such as trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents that result directly from business activities.",
