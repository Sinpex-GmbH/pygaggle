With a subscription price of EUR 9.57 per new share and a subscription ratio of 20.8:1, the acceptance rate was lifted from 44 % of shares carrying dividend rights in the previous year to approximately 50 %. A total of 1,687,527 new shares were issued and transferred to the shareholders\u2019 securities accounts in April 2019. The high acceptance rate for the scrip dividend meant that liquidity of EUR 16.1 million remained within the Company to finance investments in further growth.

This excludes any treasury shares held by the Company itself. The Company will have no rights based on these shares. The voting right begins when the statutory minimum deposit has been made on the shares.
