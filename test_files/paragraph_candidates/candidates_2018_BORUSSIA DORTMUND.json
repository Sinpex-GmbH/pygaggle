Consolidated revenue increased by 32.13% to a recordhigh EUR 536.0 million (previous year: EUR 405.7 million). In the financial year ended, consolidated net profit after taxes amounted to EUR 28.5 million (previous year: EUR 8.2 million), which was reflected in the results of operations in Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA's singleentity financial statements. The Company generated net income for the year after taxes of EUR 26.4 million (previous year: EUR 6.3 million). The Supervisory Board is therefore extremely pleased to report that it and the general partner will, for the seventh consecutive year, propose to the Annual General Meeting in November 2018 that it resolve to distribute a dividend using the net profit.",

By appointing Carsten Cramer as a third managing director, we have made the necessary adjustments to the club's organisational structure, because for us a rebuild does not simply mean out with the old and in with the new, but a return to our strengths and core values.

Despite the positive financial news, the focus lay entirely on the results of the final and 34th Bundesliga match day on 12 May 2018. Although Borussia Dortmund suffered another loss, the team ultimately qualified for the UEFA Champions League. On 14 May 2018, BVB shares were listed at EUR 5.86 and on 17 May 2018 at EUR 6.05. Following the presentation of Lucien Favre as the new head coach on 22 May 2018, a move which the market had anticipated, the shares traded at EUR 6.00. The share price then dropped, which commonly occurs after a dividend is paid out at the end of the season.",
