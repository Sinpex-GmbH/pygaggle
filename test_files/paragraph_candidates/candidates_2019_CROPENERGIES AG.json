In terms of the transport sector, less traffic also means, of course, fewer emissions, but our developed society also defines itself through mobility: driving to work or a place of training, on holiday or to the supermarket is part of our lifestyle.

Alternative fuels such as sustainably produced ethanol from renewable raw materials are already improving the greenhouse gas balance and also significantly lowering particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions. The fact that the fuel filler cap on all new vehicles now refers to their compatibility with Super E10 is to be welcomed.

The adoption of the European \u201cRenewable Energy Directive\u201d in December 2018 makes a path to less \u00ad fossil energy and more greenhouse gas reductions up to 2030 visible. How concrete implementation is to be carried out in the member states and who is to make the huge investment in production capacity, infrastructure and vehicles remains to be seen over the next few years, though this will depend, to a significant extent, on the price signals that the individual EU member states are prepared to send for fewer greenhouse gas emissions and on the investment strength that the established industry in particular develops.",

Additionally, as a result of its complete utilisation of raw materials, CropEnergies has an attractive portfolio of high-grade food and animal feed products as well as neutral alcohol. This reduces the dependence on developments on the ethanol and raw material markets. Company operations, external influences and corporate actions to secure the existence, growth and success of an undertaking are subject to opportunities and risks. In order to identify these and actively manage them, CropEnergies has set up a group-wide risk management system.",
